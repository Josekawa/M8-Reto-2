# CRONOS2 Wave 4 – Data Visualization Project

This project was developed as part of the university course **Module 8 – Data Visualization**.  
It uses the dataset **CRONOS2 Wave 4** to explore **trust in institutions** across countries and sociodemographic groups.

## Objectives
- Understand and describe the dataset through **exploratory data analysis (EDA)**.  
- Define the audience and the main research questions to be answered with the dashboard.  
- Select appropriate charts and visual encodings based on visualization principles.  
- Design an interactive dashboard sketch showing the most relevant insights.  
- Summarize the main findings in a technical report and a short presentation.

## Main Findings
- The sample includes **more than 6,000 respondents** from multiple European countries.  
- The **average age** is around 45 years (with wide variability across individuals).  
- Reported **income satisfaction** is moderate, averaging around 5 on a 0–10 scale.  
- **Institutional trust** shows clear differences between institutions (e.g. higher in the police, lower in political parties) and varies across demographic and socioeconomic groups.  

## Repository Structure
- `Dashboard/` → HTML and Rmd
- `Datos/ → raw and cleaned datasets + script(`CRON2W4e01.csv`, `CRON2W4e01_depurado.csv`) + script
- `presentacion` → HTML and Rmd
- `informe.Rmd` → technical report generated with **knitr**  

## Requirements
This project was implemented in **R** using:
- `tidyverse`  
- `ggplot2`  
- `knitr`
